    <h1>
        What Is SDG 7?
    </h1>

    
    
    <p>
      SDG 7 is one of the 17 goals set by the United States which are to be accomplished by 2030.
      SDG 7 has five 'outcome objectives': equal access to modern energy;
      increasing the global share of renewable energy; doubling energy efficiency gains;
      encouraging access to sustainable energy science, technologies and investment; and extending and enhancing energy resources for developed countries.
      But the rising danger of Energy Wastage will devastate our planet if it is not stopped.
