    <h1>
        What Are The Causes And Effects?
    </h1>

    <h2>
        Causes:
    </h2>

    <p>
        There are many causes of this issue which are mainly caused because of carelessness or unawerness
        about the issue. Many of of those causes include:
    </p>

    <p>
        1. Leaving the lights on.
    </p>

    <p>
        2. Using Incandescent Bulbs
    </p>

    <p>
        3. Leaving Electronics Plugged In
    </p>
         4. Leaving heaters/Acs open for a long time
    <p>
        5. Using products under 3 stars
    </p>

    <p>
        And more.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Effects:
    </h2>

    <p>
        People might not understand the importance of the issue but it has very harmful 
        effects on the environment and you. For example:
    </p>

    <p>
        Your carbon footprint will take a giant leap in the sky
        towards the hirghts unimaginable. A carbon footprint is 
        basically The cumulative greenhouse gas emissions that 
        an individual, incident, agency, operation, or product creates.
    </p>

    <p>
        Another famous example can be climate change. It can be caused by burning 
        of fossil fuels which again increases your carbon footprint and releases
        tons of carbon dioxide in the atmostphere which will cause natural
        disasters.
    </p>

    <p>
        Reduction of supply will be the greatest effect we, humans will face if this
        continues any longer. You see, fossil fuels are limited in supply and are finite
        which provides a risk of them being extinct or, very few in numbers which will drive 
        a huge number of humans to no power as a lot of us depend on them as our main power supply
